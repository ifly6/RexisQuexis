_Management for GA RexisQuexis_

> This program is a small program in Java which helps me automate significant parts of formatting General Assembly resolutions from the form in which they are displayed on the NationStates website into the appropriate formatting for the forum thread on the General Assembly forum.

*Nb* the only reason why this isn't written as a command-line function is because the command line doesn't format spaces correctly, and at the time this was created, there was no way to fetch data from the NationStates API on resolutions. While that has changed since then, I just don't feel like rewriting the core of the program.
