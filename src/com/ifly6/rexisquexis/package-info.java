/**
 * Classes in this package depend on a frankly ridiculous number of dependencies. Please do not actually use them in
 * deployment. Due to arbitrary and unpredictable changes in the NationStates API, I wholly recommend that you use this
 * entirely in an IDE like IntelliJ and deploy, debug, and test from there.
 * To make this work in IntelliJ you will also need to download the JavaTelegram library and add that as a dependency. I
 * should note that the JavaTelegram module's NS-API components are currently under active development, so they may
 * change erratically as well.
 * Frankly, I don't recommend you actually run the code here.
